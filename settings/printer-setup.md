{% hint style="info" %}
Be sure that you have Java installed on your system. Using Internet Explorer or Safari go to this URL and you will be able to confirm that you are running the most current version of Java https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp
{% endhint %}

Set up your printers for Product and Shipping labels. Each dropdown is self-explanatory as to which printer you are setting up. Just run the program and you should then see your printers listed. The LP program that was installed at the beginning of your setup process is the key to the web application being able to print. It MUST be running in the background at all times so if you restart your computer for some reason you will need to run the installed program again before going to the web app.

{% hint style="warning" %}
 If for any reason you do not see any printers in the dropdown it means that the LP application is not running on your computer.
{% endhint %}
